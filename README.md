## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
in completing this project, i learnt how to create a different variation of a hover state and that was something i haven't tried before so it was interesting.


### Continued development
in future projects i plan to focus more on using CSS Grid and generally understand the ways to make responsive design layouts with CSS

### Useful resources
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - as usually, w3schools has always been a good resource, but they were mainly effective in my understanding of the box shadow.
